- 👋 Hi, I’m @LConfer
- 👀 I’m recently retired and thought I'd join Github to get back into some coding that I used to do as a hobby. I was a biochemist by trade, but also hold a certification in client/server SQL systems, all be it that it's 20 years old. I thought I'd dabble again in coding as something to do from home to keep my mind active.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on maybe some RTSP to play with home monitoring ??? (It may take me awhile to get up to speed).
- 📫 How to reach me ...  Github.LesConfer@gmail.com
